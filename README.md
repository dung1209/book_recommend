The book_recommend project serves as an API designed to provide personalized book recommendations for the bookstore platform. It offers two main functionalities: for non-logged-in users, it suggests popular and best-selling books to engage potential customers; for logged-in users, it delivers tailored recommendations based on their purchase history, browsing behavior, and interactions. By combining Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF) techniques, the API ensures accurate and relevant suggestions, enhancing user experience and boosting sales.
